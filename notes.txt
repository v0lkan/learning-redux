The entire state is a single JavaScript object.
(including the data and the UI state)

The state tree is read-only.
The only way to change the state-tree is by dispatching an action.

And action is the minimum representation of the change in the data.

Use pure functions.

the view layer is the most predictable when it is described as a pure function of the application state.

the state state mutations in your app need to be described as a pure function that takes the previous state, and the action to be dispatched.
and returns the next state of your application.

fn(prevState, action, nextState) => reducer
